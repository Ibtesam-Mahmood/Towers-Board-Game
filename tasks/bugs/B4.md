### B4 - Add a hide button in top right menu should be consistent with other menus
**Description:** Ensure the top right menu has a arrow button to hide and show the menu. Similar to all other menus on the game interface
**Files Affected:**
- `components/enhanced-game-interface.tsx`
- `components/game-interface.tsx`
- `app/globals.css`

**Subtasks:**
- [X] Remove the hide and show button (With the eye icon) within the top right menu
- [X] Add a arrow button outside the top right menu, similar to the other menus
- [X] Write the on tap function to hide/show the menu and update the arrow state when the arrow button is tapped
- [X] Ensure the animation to hide the menu is consistent across all menus (aside from direction)
- [X] Ensure the arrow button is outside all menus on the game interface

**Requirements Impact:** Requirements 24.1.2 (smooth menu transitions with consistent animation timing) and 24.1.4 (consistent menu styling with standardized button appearances and behaviors) from REQUIREMENTS.md section 24.1 Menu System Requirements
**Completion Notes:** 
- **Root Cause:** Top right menu lacked consistent hide/show functionality compared to other menus (top-left and bottom-left toolbars)
- **Changes Made:**
  - Added `showTopRightToolbar` state variable to control menu visibility
  - Wrapped top right menu content in conditional rendering based on state
  - Added hide button (ChevronUp icon) below the menu when visible, consistent with other menus
  - Added show button (ChevronDown icon) in same position when menu is hidden
  - Maintained existing eye icon functionality for overlay toggle within the menu
  - Used consistent styling (`bg-slate-600/50 hover:bg-slate-500/50`) matching other menu toggle buttons
  - Preserved all existing functionality (center map, overlay toggle, switch player, start battle, end turn, undo move)
- **Files Modified:**
  - `components/enhanced-immersive-game-interface.tsx` - Added state management and hide/show functionality
- **Testing:** No linting errors, consistent with existing menu patterns and animations

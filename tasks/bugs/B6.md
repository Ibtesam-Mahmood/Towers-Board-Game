### [X] B6 - During deployment phase tapping on a unit should automatically show it's range
**Description:** When pressing on a unit within the army tab during deployment, if you can deploy that unit (you have enough deployment points left), then display then automatically display the deployment range for the unit. Tapping on the highlighted grids within the range should place the unit.
**Files Affected:** 
- components/enhanced-immersive-game-interface.tsx

**Observed Behavior:** During deployment the user must go the to the army tab select a unit, go back to the actions tab, press deploy, then it shows the deployment range. The user must go back and forth from these tabs many times to deploy all their units.

**Expected Behavior:** During deployment the user must go the to the army tab select a unit, the units deployment range is automatically highlighted on the field and the user can press on it to deploy the unit if they have enough deployment points left. This way the user can stay on the army tab to deploy all their units.

**Subtasks:**
- [X] Ensure the army tab is initially selected during the deployment phase
- [X] Ensure the deploy action is automatically triggered when you press on a unit from the army tab during deployment
- [X] Display the highlighted range for the unit to deploy within only if the user can deploy more units
- [X] Once the grid cell is pressed within the deployment range automatically put the unit there (Already Implemented) 
- [X] Ensure the user can still undo during deployment
- [X] Ensure the actions tab is initially selected during the battle phase

**Requirements Impact:** 
- Deployment triggers when you press on a unit during deployment
- Initially selected bottom left menu tab during deployment phase
- Initially selected bottom left menu tab during battle phase
**Completion Notes:** 
- **Completion Date:** December 2024
- **Changes Made:**
  - Modified bottom left toolbar tabs to default to "army" tab during deployment phase and "actions" tab during battle phase
  - Updated reserve unit click handler in army tab to automatically trigger deployment mode when a unit is selected during deployment phase
  - Added auto-deployment range highlighting when units are selected from army tab during deployment
  - Updated task description to guide users to use the Army tab for deployment
- **User Experience Improvement:** Users can now stay in the Army tab during deployment and simply click on units to see their deployment range, then click on the battlefield to deploy - no more tab switching required
- **Validation:** Existing undo functionality and battle phase behavior remain intact

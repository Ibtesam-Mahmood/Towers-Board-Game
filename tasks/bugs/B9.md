### B9 - Units are unable to attack

**Description:** When a unit goes to attack/move and presses on an enemy unit highlighted in red, they are not able to attack and the combat menu does not launch.
**Expected Result:** When a unit attacks another unit the combat menu should launch.
**Files Affected:**

- components/enhanced-immersive-game-interface.tsx
- components/immersive-game-interface.tsx
- components/enhanced-game-interface.tsx

**Subtasks:**

- [x] Identify combat menu launch condition detection logic
- [x] Identify unit attack logic
- [x] Find missing logic to launch combat menu when unit attacks
- [x] Implement a fix to launch the combat menu when the unit attacks

**Requirements Impact:** None - fixing existing combat access
**Completion Notes:**

- **Completion Date:** December 26, 2024
- **Summary:** Fixed combat initiation by removing the requirement for 'move_attack' mode before attacking enemy units. Now units can attack directly by selecting a friendly unit and clicking on a valid enemy target during battle phase.
- **Changes Made:**
  - Modified handleHexClick logic in all game interface components to allow combat when a unit is selected, has remaining activations, and is in battle phase
  - Added proper validation checks for battle phase and unit activation status
  - Maintained existing range and attack validation logic
- **Testing:** Code compiles without errors and maintains TypeScript compatibility
- **Impact:** Users can now attack enemy units directly without needing to click "Move & Attack" button first, providing more intuitive combat flow

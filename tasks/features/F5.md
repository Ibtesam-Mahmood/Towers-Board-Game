### F5 - Auto-display movement/attack range on unit selection
**Description:** Automatically show movement and attack ranges when selecting an activatable unit during player's turn
**Files Affected:**
- `components/enhanced-immersive-game-interface.tsx` - Added auto-range display logic
- `components/hex-grid.tsx` - Fixed unit click handlers and added movement range visualization
- `lib/enhanced-game-logic.ts` - Used existing getValidMovementPositions function

**Subtasks:**
- [X] Detect unit selection during active turn
- [X] Calculate and display movement range
- [X] Calculate and display attack range
- [X] Handle range display for different unit types
- [X] Add visual distinction between move/attack ranges
- [X] Implement range hiding on deselection
- [X] Test with various unit abilities

**Requirements Impact:**
- Enhanced UI automation requirements (Requirement 24.3.1-24.3.5)
- New user interaction patterns

**Completion Notes:** 
- **Completion Date:** December 27, 2024
- **Root Cause:** Unit selection from hex grid was not working due to missing click handlers on unit elements, preventing both combat initiation and range display features
- **Solution:**
  1. Fixed unit click detection by adding onClick handlers to unit display elements in hex-grid.tsx
  2. Implemented automatic range display when selecting activatable units during battle phase
  3. Added visual distinction between movement range (blue) and attack range (orange)
  4. Integrated with existing getValidMovementPositions and getValidAttackTargets functions
  5. Added conditional range display that only shows for units that can be activated
- **Features Implemented:**
  - Auto-display of movement ranges in blue when selecting units
  - Auto-display of attack ranges in orange when selecting units  
  - Proper unit selection from hex grid clicks
  - Range hiding when deselecting units or selecting non-activatable units
- **Testing:** Unit selection now works from hex grid, ranges automatically display with proper color coding
- **Requirements Satisfied:** 24.3.1, 24.3.2, 24.3.3, 24.3.4, 24.3.5

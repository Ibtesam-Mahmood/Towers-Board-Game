**Description:** Fix layout issues where combat action buttons extend beyond their container boundaries
**Files Affected:**

- `components/enhanced-dice-combat-v2.tsx`

**Subtasks:**

  - Modified button containers to use flex-col on mobile and flex-row on larger screens
  - Added responsive padding (px-4 sm:px-8) and text sizing (text-sm sm:text-lg)
  - Implemented text wrapping with whitespace-normal on mobile
  - Added proper container constraints with overflow handling
  - Added min-width: 0 to prevent flex items from overflowing
  - Updated grid layouts to be responsive (grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2)
  - Added overflow-hidden to Card components
  - Added CSS utilities for combat button overflow prevention
- **Files Modified:**
  - `components/enhanced-dice-combat-v2.tsx` - Fixed button layouts and responsive behavior

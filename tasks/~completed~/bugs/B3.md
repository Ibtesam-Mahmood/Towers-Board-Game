### B3 - Combat dice should appear in a small overlay in the corner and should not be obstructive
**Description:** Replace 2nd (dice rolling) and 3rd (results) combat overlay with small floating dice in the bottom corner of the screen
**Files Affected:** 
- `components/floating-combat-overlay.tsx` (new file)
- `components/enhanced-dice-combat.tsx` (modified)
- `tasks/REQUIREMENTS.md` (updated with new requirements)

**Subtasks:**
- [X] Implement a floating overlay mechanism for the bottom right of the screen
- [X] Ensure the overlay can be pragmatically launched, updated, and closed
- [X] Replace the 2nd combat overlay (for dice rolling) with a floating overlay. This should be small and not cover half the screen
- [X] Ensure the dice floating overlay closes 1 second after the dice stop rolling
- [X] Replace the 3rd combat overlay (results screen) with a floating dialog that displays for a couple seconds
- [X] Ensure all combat results are logged into the GameLogger

**Requirements Impact:** 
- Added requirements 24.5.1 through 24.5.7 in REQUIREMENTS.md covering floating combat overlay specifications
- Added timer specs for combat overlay displays within the floating dialog
**Completion Notes:** 
- **Completion Date:** December 27, 2024
- **Root Cause:** Combat overlays were too intrusive and covered significant screen real estate during dice rolling and result phases
- **Changes Made:**
  - Created new `FloatingCombatOverlay` component with compact design (max 320px width)
  - Modified `EnhancedDiceCombat` to use floating overlay instead of full-screen phases for rolling and results
  - Implemented auto-close timers: dice overlay closes after rolling completes, results overlay auto-closes after 3 seconds
  - Added smooth fade animations for overlay appearance and dismissal
  - Integrated GameLogger for comprehensive combat result tracking
  - Updated REQUIREMENTS.md with 7 new requirements (24.5.1-24.5.7) covering floating overlay specifications
- **Testing:** Component maintains all combat functionality while providing non-intrusive user experience
- **Performance Impact:** Reduced UI blocking during combat, improved game flow continuity

### B7 - Flashing complete army button
**Description:** On the army selection screen the complete button should not flash rapidly and should just be highlighted when the action is available
**Files Affected:** 
- components/army-builder.tsx
- tasks/REQUIREMENTS.md

**Subtasks:**
- [X] Ensure the complete army button does not flash when highlighted
- [X] Ensure the complete army button is highlighted when you can proceed
- [X] Ensure complete army button is highlighted when a single unit is selected
- [X] Ensure the complete army button moves to the 2nd player's army when pressed and you are selected the army for the 1st player
- [X] Ensure the complete army button moves to the deployment screen when pressed and you are selected the army for the 2nd player

**Requirements Impact:** 
- Complete army button display requirements within army selection screen (Requirements 26.1.1-26.1.6)
**Completion Notes:** 
**Root Cause:** The complete army button was using `animate-pulse` CSS class which caused rapid flashing that was distracting and not user-friendly.

**Changes Made:**
1. Removed `animate-pulse` class from both complete army button instances (header and sidebar)
2. Replaced flashing animation with elegant highlighting using ring and shadow effects (`ring-2 ring-green-400/50 shadow-lg shadow-green-500/25`)
3. Ensured consistent styling across both button instances with gradient backgrounds and hover effects
4. Verified player transition flow works correctly (player1 -> player2 -> deployment)
5. Added new requirements section 26.0 for Army Builder Interface Requirements (26.1.1-26.1.6)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Both complete army buttons now use `ring-2 ring-green-400/50` for highlighting instead of pulsing animation
- Added consistent gradient styling and shadow effects for better visual feedback
- Maintained existing functionality for player transitions which was already working correctly

### B8 - Game not ending when one army has no units left
**Description:** Fix game state detection to properly end the game when a player has no remaining units. End the round and move to the next round.
**Files Affected:** 
- `lib/enhanced-game-logic.ts` - Enhanced victory condition checking and skirmish/match progression
- `components/enhanced-immersive-game-interface.tsx` - Updated victory condition handling
- `components/towers-game.tsx` - Added skirmish-end phase UI and next round progression

**Subtasks:**
- [X] Identify win condition detection logic
- [X] Fix unit count checking
- [X] Implement proper game end triggers
- [X] Add game end UI notifications
- [X] Move to the next round if the player has not won yet based on the rules listed in `README.md`
- [X] Verify that the game ends once there are no more rounds left.

**Requirements Impact:** 
- Game end logic (Requirements 16.2.2, 16.2.3 - Victory detection and match progression)
- Added proper skirmish-end phase handling per game types interface
- Implemented best-of-3 match format with unit persistence between rounds

**Completion Notes:** 
**Root Cause:** The victory condition checking was only active during the battle phase and lacked proper skirmish/match progression logic. The game would detect unit elimination but fail to properly transition between skirmishes or end the match.

**Changes Made:**
1. **Enhanced Victory Condition Logic**: Modified `EnhancedGameManager.checkVictoryConditions()` to:
   - Check victory conditions during both deployment and battle phases (not just battle)
   - Return detailed information about whether it's a skirmish end vs match end
   - Properly calculate if a skirmish win results in match victory (2/3 skirmishes)

2. **Added Skirmish Progression Functions**: 
   - `endSkirmish()` - Handles awarding points and determining next phase
   - `startNextRound()` - Resets game state for next skirmish while preserving surviving units

3. **Implemented Skirmish-End Phase UI**: Added proper UI screen showing:
   - Which player won the current skirmish
   - Current match score (X-Y format)
   - "Next Round" button if match continues, or "Play Again" if match is over

4. **Fixed Unit Persistence**: Surviving units carry forward to next skirmish in reserves, dead units are permanently removed (matching README rules)

5. **Proper Match End Detection**: Game correctly ends when either player reaches 2 skirmish wins, displaying final match results

The game now properly handles the complete match flow: army building → deployment → battle → skirmish end → (next round OR match end), ensuring no games get stuck when one army is eliminated.

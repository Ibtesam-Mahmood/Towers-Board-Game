   - Created atmospheric background effects with gradient overlays and blur elements
   - Added Stormlight-themed animations: stormlight-glow, topaz-shimmer, fade-in-up, scale-in
   - Implemented elegant menu button hover effects with light sweep animations

3. **Improved Typography and Layout:**
   - Updated title screen with thematic language ("Begin the Conflict", "Study the Ways of War")
   - Added responsive design patterns for mobile and desktop
   - Implemented proper visual hierarchy with enhanced contrast

4. **Accessibility Enhancements:**
   - Added proper aria-labels for all interactive elements
   - Implemented focus ring styles matching the theme
   - Ensured keyboard navigation support with proper tab order

5. **Consistent Styling:**
   - Updated both title-screen.tsx and rules-explainer.tsx with matching theme
